/**
 * A vector object for geographic features with a geometry and other attribute
 * properties, similar to the features in vector file formats like GeoJSON.
 *
 * Features can be styled individually with `setStyle`; otherwise they use the
 * style of their vector layer.
 *
 * Note that attribute properties are set as {@link ol.Object} properties on the
 * feature object, so they are observable, and have get/set accessors.
 *
 * Typically, a feature has a single geometry property. You can set the geometry
 * using the `setGeometry` method and get it with `getGeometry`. It is possible
 * to store more than one geometry on a feature using attribute properties. By
 * default, the geometry used for rendering is identified by the property name
 * `geometry`. If you want to use another geometry property for rendering, use
 * the `setGeometryName` method to change the attribute property associated with
 * the geometry for the feature. For example:
 *
 * ```js var feature = new ol.Feature({ geometry: new
 * ol.geom.Polygon(polyCoords), labelPoint: new ol.geom.Point(labelCoords),
 * name: 'My Polygon' });
 *
 * // get the polygon geometry var poly = feature.getGeometry();
 *
 * // Render the feature as a point using the coordinates from labelPoint
 * feature.setGeometryName('labelPoint');
 *
 * // get the point geometry var point = feature.getGeometry(); ```
